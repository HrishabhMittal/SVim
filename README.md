# SVim (Smaller Vim)

This is a small project made in Go, just to kinda get familiar with the language.

# Current Progress

- SIMPLE INSERT MODE
- SIMPLE NORMAL MODE (just saving and quiting implemented)

# Plans

- implement more and more NORMAL MODE commmands
- implement visual and visual block mode
